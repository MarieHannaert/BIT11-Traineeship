# BIT10-Traineeship
All the scripts I made during my traineeship by ILVO eenheid Plant. 

In the directory /readme_per_subject, you can find all the subjects I did during my internship. 
These will only be added when a subject is completed, the uncompleted subjects are always added on the day I worked on it in my one note. 

The purpose of my internship is creating pipelines for processing whole bacterial genomes.
